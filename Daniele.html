			<p class="special-content">Of all the deaths attributed to cancer, 90% are due to
metastasis, or the spread of cancer cells from a primary tumor to
distant organs, and treatments that prevent or cure metastasis remain
elusive. Emerging data indicate that low oxygen states within a tumor,
termed hypoxia, can alter the chemical and physical parameters of the
extracellular matrix (ECM), or scaffold of the tumor tissue. These
changes generate a microenvironment that may influence metastasis.
During tumor evolution, changes in the composition and the overall
content of the ECM reflect both its biophysical and biological properties
and these strongly influence cancer cell properties, such as cellular
proliferation and cell motility. The talk will cover how hypoxia arises
within normal tissue and also in tumor tissue. A discussion of the role of hypoxia in collagen biogenesis
which influences compositional changes to the tumor microenvironment will reveal how hypoxia influences
metastasis. The challenges in quantifying the extent of hypoxia within a tumor and modeling the dynamic
changes in the microenvironment will also be considered. </p>

cancer biology from the University of South Florida. She is currently an assistant professor in the
departments of Oncology as well as Chemical and Molecular Engineering at the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine. Her research goal is to develop a breast cancer research program which utilizes new
technologies that can rapidly advance our understanding of how the microenvironment, in particular
hypoxia and hypoxia-induced genetic changes, promote breast cancer metastasis. The overall objective is
to identify therapeutic strategies that focus on metastasis treatment and prevention strategies for breast
cancer patients.</p>
