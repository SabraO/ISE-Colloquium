            <p class="special-content">One of the challenging problems in brain imaging research is a principled incorporation of information from
				different imaging modalities. Frequently, each modality is analyzed separately using, for instance,
				dimensionality reduction techniques, which result in a loss of mutual information. We propose a novel
				regularization method to estimate the association between the brain structure features and a scalar outcome
				within the linear regression framework. Our regularization technique provides a principled approach to use
				external information from the structural brain connectivity and inform the estimation of the regression
				coefficients. Our proposal extends the classical Tikhonov regularization framework by defining a penalty
				term based on the structural connectivity-derived Laplacian matrix. The approach is first illustrated using
				simulated data and compared with other penalized regression methods. We then apply our regularization
				method to study the associations between the alcoholism phenotypes and brain cortical thickness using a
				diffusion imaging derived measure of structural connectivity. Using the proposed methodology in 148 young
				male subjects with a risk for alcoholism, we found negative associations between cortical thickness and
				drinks per drinking day in bilateral caudal anterior cingulate cortex, left lateral OFC and left precentral gyrus.
