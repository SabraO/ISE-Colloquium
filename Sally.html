            </div>
            <p class="special-content">Dr. Sally Ellingson is a computational scientist working at the intersection of computational biology and high-performance computing. She has undergraduate degrees in computer science and mathematics from Florida Institute of Technology. She obtained her doctoral degree at the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory under a fellowship funded by the National Science Foundation in computational biology. She is an assistant professor in the Division of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine. In her additional role as the manager for High-Performance Computing Services for the Markey Cancer Center’s Cancer Research Informatics Shared Resource Facility she facilitates high throughput genomics and big data processing for precision medicine resulting in targeted cancer therapies. Dr. Ellingson is currently a KL2 scholar awarded by the University of Kentucky Center for Clinical and Translational Sciences and a Research Affiliate at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. With her passion for high-performance computing, her research goals lie in harnessing computational power for discoveries otherwise not possible in biomedical areas of high societal importance.

                Dr. Ellingson engages in mentoring and outreach, especially for underrepresented groups in computational sciences. Since graduation she has been actively engaged in the organization of the student programs at Supercomputing, the largest conference in high-performance computing. She is the main chair for the student volunteer program this year and keeps the diversity of program participants a priority. She also organizes and volunteers for the Broader Engagement program at the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics: Computational Sciences and Engineering meeting.
