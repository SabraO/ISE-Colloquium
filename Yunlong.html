            <p class="special-content">As the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), trillions of widely-distributed devices are integrated for
                health monitoring, biomedical sensing, environmental protection, infrastructure monitoring, and security. The traditional technology for
                powering these devices is using batteries, which might not be an optimal solution due to the limited lifetime, difficulties for replacement
                and maintenance, and potential environmental issues. To provide a sustainable power solution, triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has been
                developed since 2012 for high-efficiency mechanical energy harvesting from ambient environment. TENG has very unique output characteristics
                including the high voltage and the limited current density. Thus, it is challenging to directly power most of commercial electronics in high
                efficiency. However, these features also bring opportunities for high-voltage applications. Here, starting from the fundamental studies of
                TENG operation cycles through the voltage-charge plots, series of important research studies have been conducted, including two aspects:
                (1) developing designed energy storage or power-management solutions for TENG to power electronics in high efficiency; (2) demonstrating
                TENG as a controllable high-voltage power source for various applications. These studies will drive the further development of TENG technology
                for broad applications and industrializations, towards high-efficiency selfpowered systems.

            </div>
            <p class="special-content">Dr. Yunlong Zi is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the School of Materials Science and Engineering at
                Georgia Institute of Technology, and he will join Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong
                as an Assistant Professor very soon. Dr. Zi received his Ph.D. in Physics from Purdue University in 2014; his Bachelor of Engineering in
                Materials Science and Engineering from Tsinghua University in 2009. His current research interests focus on high-efficiency mechanical energy
                harvesting through triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG), TENG triggered high-voltage applications, and self-powered systems.
                As the 1st author, his research studies have been published in top-notch journals, including Nature Nanotechnology, Nature Communications,
                Advanced Materials, Nano Letters, ACS Nano, Nano Energy, and etc. He was honored as the winner of MRS Postdoctoral
                Award by Materials Research Society in 2017, as the first recipient from Georgia Tech; and one of “5 students who are transformation makers”
                by Purdue University in 2013, as highlighted in Purdue homepage.
